## Research Agenda

My research develops at the intersection of strategic communication, innovation ecosystems and gender studies. I examine how communication operates as a structuring mechanism in emerging entrepreneurial environments, shaping visibility, legitimacy and institutional positioning.

My work seeks to advance theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of communication in early-stage organisations, with particular attention to gender dynamics and innovation-driven cultural contexts.

## Core Research Areas

### Strategic Communication in Innovation-Driven Organisations

I investigate how startups and entrepreneurial ecosystems design communication strategies to build legitimacy, attract stakeholders and navigate institutional uncertainty. This line of research analyses communicative governance, reputation-building processes and digital strategic positioning in early-stage ventures.

### Gender, Legitimacy and Entrepreneurial Visibility

A central dimension of my research examines how gender influences communicative practices, recognition dynamics and legitimacy construction within startup ecosystems. I explore structural communication gaps and develop analytical frameworks to support more inclusive and equitable innovation environments.

### Cultural and Tourism Innovation Ecosystems

I also study startup hubs embedded in cultural and tourism institutions, particularly museums as emerging actors in urban innovation systems. This research analyses their hybrid organisational nature and their role in fostering entrepreneurial ecosystems within creative cities.

## Methodological Approach

My research combines qualitative and quantitative designs, including case studies, strategic communication audits, content analysis, digital trace data analysis and platform-based methodological experimentation. I integrate perspectives from communication theory, innovation studies and gender research.
